# EmiHubCore-Lite
This is the source code to this resource: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/emihubcore-customizable-hub-plugin-menus-hotbar-items-animated-scoreboard-and-other-features.113803/

I never really could sell the full version of this, though I kept it and decided to at least open source the lite version which is far away from the full version. 

# Usage
Do whatever you want, no matter what, I don't care. Just leave my name: "Emmiesa", in the authors sections and let others know when asked. (though I don't think anybody is gonna use this as a base because of this being very old and not updated like the full version)
